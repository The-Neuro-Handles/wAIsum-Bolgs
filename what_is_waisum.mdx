#### 🫵: You
* Hi, what is this Waisum?
#### 🤖: wAIΣ
* Hello, welcome to **Waisum**, this is a platform dedicated to all the AI enthusiasts 🚀 who are willing to explore **AI insights**, **collaboration** to build models that serve various purposes and importantly learn the basic building blocks of AI.
#### 🫵: You
* So are you going to be like OpenAI or Google DeepMind in the future?
#### 🤖: wAIΣ
* Not at all, we are just trying to give engineers perspective on implementing basic models and give insights into implementation details and challenges faced while developing these models

#### 🫵: You
* Okay, is there any significance for your ‘Waisum’ name or is it just random?
#### 🤖: wAIΣ
* Waisum = ‘weighted’ + ‘sum’

* At the basic level what all AI algorithms do is combine different features multiplied with corresponding weights concerning these features and give an output or prediction based on the sum, these weights are the result of what is so-called training and the output is called prediction.
```python
def waisum(features, weights):
    return sum([f*w for f, w in zip(features, weights)])
```

#### 🫵: You
* 😵‍💫 That seems very technical, could you explain in simpler terms?
#### 🤖: wAIΣ

* Sorry for the confusion😅. Imagine you are unlocking your phone with your face, the AI algorithm tries to predict your face by combining all of your features such as your ears, eyes, facial features and each features has their weights and sum of the their products of weights and features gives you a weighted sum


* At the crux, Waisum is a symbolic representation of the basic method in which AI algorithms work, so we define us as Basic



#### 🫵: You
* Now that I understand your goal, can I expect any of your AI algorithms similar to ChatGPT, DALLE etc.?
#### 🤖: wAIΣ
* Hopefully 😁, just kidding. All these models took years of research and more importantly trained on the largest computer clusters across the globe, which we are not doing.
* You might be surprised to hear this, but these might be just alphabets of the language or electric light bulb moment and we are yet to witness what this intelligence is capable of.
* Answering your question, at Waisum we are trying to develop basic building blocks of AI, these models are going to be soon available! 😃. We are strong believers in AI positive impact on this world just like how electricity has lightened our homes


#### 🫵: You
* So, can I implement these models on my computer?
#### 🤖: wAIΣ
*  Of course, with every model we bring in the form of experiments, we try to make it available on GitHub as an Opensource, and guidelines to implement it and if you are interested, we can even collaborate.




#### 🫵: You
* What if I get stuck at some step or find any bugs in your model, what should I do?
#### 🤖: wAIΣ
*  That is exactly where our Blogs and GitHub are going to help.
 If you want to skip challenges that we faced during the development reading our insights in the form of blogs will make your development faster, we will try to do our best to address different challenges and try to explain different concepts in a simpler term. 
* For bugs, you list them in the issues section which can help us work together to solve
* We aim to make every one of us on the same page.




#### 🫵: You
* Great! Looking forward to seeing what AI models/experiments you are going to try.
#### 🤖: wAIΣ
*  Yes, we are also very excited to launch our first model. 
* Like we said earlier we will be building basic models and launching them very soon! Stay tuned.

#### 🫵: You
* It was nice talking to you, Waisum.
#### 🤖: wAIΣ
*  Indeed, thanks for checking us. I hope you had a good time!
